    "Title":"Saturn-Ringed Planet.",
    "Named after":"The Roman deity of wealth and agriculture, who was also Jupiter's father, is honored by the planet's name.",
    "basic description":"Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, and the second-largest planet in our solar system.It is well nown for its Beautiful rings which give it distinct look among other planets in our solar system. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of moons",
    "rings":"It is believed that Saturn's rings are fragments of comets, asteroids, or broken moons that were ripped apart by Saturn's strong gravity before they could reach the planet.  They are composed of billions of tiny pieces of rock and ice that have been covered in dust and other substances.  The majority of the ring particles are small, dust-sized ice grains or large, house-sized chunks.  Some particles have the size of mountains.  If viewed from Saturn's cloud tops, the rings would appear primarily white, and it's interesting to note that each ring circles the planet at a different speed.The vertical height of Saturn's main rings is normally around 30 feet (10 meters), but the ring system stretches up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet.  Except for the Cassini Division, a 2,920-mile (4,700-kilometer) chasm that divides Rings A and B, the rings are fairly close to one another and are named alphabetically in the order in which they were found.  A, B, and C are the primary rings.  The fainter and more recent rings are D, E, F, and G.",
    "moons":"There are many fascinating and unusual worlds on Saturn.  Each of Saturn's moons, from the haze-covered Titan to the crater-filled Phoebe, contributes to the narrative of the Saturn system.  There are currently 146 moons orbiting Saturn as of June 8, 2023, and more are pending confirmation of their discovery and formal designation by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).",
    "size": "Diameter-120,500 kilometers",
    "Distance from Sun": "1.4 billion kilometers",
    "Age": "4.503 billion years",
    "Duration of one day":"10.7 hours",
    "details":"",
    "basic composition":" Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. At Saturn's center is a dense core of metals like iron and nickel surrounded by rocky material and other compounds solidified by intense pressure and heat",
    "possibility for life":"The environment on Saturn is unsuitable for life as we know it.  Most likely, life cannot adapt to the extremes and volatility of the materials, pressures, and temperatures that define this planet.  Although the planet Saturn is not a plausible environment for life to establish itself, several of its numerous moons are.  Life may exist on satellites with interior oceans, such as Titan and Enceladus.",
    "Formation":"About 4.5 billion years ago, while the rest of the solar system was forming, gravity drew spinning gas and dust in to form Saturn, a gas giant.  Saturn moved into its current location as the sixth planet from the Sun in the outer solar system some 4 billion years ago.  Similar to Jupiter, Saturn is primarily composed of the same two elements that make up the Sun: hydrogen and helium.",
    "structure":"Gravity drew swirling gas and dust in to form Saturn, a gas giant, some 4.5 billion years ago, while the rest of the solar system was forming.  Saturn found its current location in the outer solar system, as the sixth planet from the Sun, some 4 billion years ago.  The two primary elements that make up the Sun, hydrogen and helium, also make up Saturn and Jupiter.",
    "surface":"As a gas giant, Saturn doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet would crush, melt, and vaporize any spacecraft trying to fly into the planet",
    "atmosphere":"The clouds covering Saturn take the form of storms, jet streams, and faint stripes.  There are numerous shades of gray, brown, and yellow on the earth.Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 1,600 feet per second (500 meters per second) in the equatorial region. In contrast, the strongest hurricane-force winds on Earth top out at about 360 feet per second (110 meters per second). And the pressure – the same kind you feel when you dive deep underwater – is so powerful it squeezes gas into a liquid.A six-sided jet stream is an intriguing atmospheric feature on Saturn's north pole.  Images from the Voyager I spacecraft initially revealed this hexagon-shaped pattern, which the Cassini spacecraft has since examined more closely.  With a huge, revolving storm at its center, the hexagon, which is roughly 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across, is a wavy jet stream of winds of 200 miles per hour (about 322 kilometers per hour).  It is the only weather feature of its kind in the solar system.",
    "orbit and rotation":"In the solar system, Saturn has the second-shortest day.  Saturn completes one orbit around the Sun (one year in Saturnian time) in roughly 29.4 Earth years (10,756 Earth days), and a day on Saturn only takes 10.7 hours (the time it takes for Saturn to rotate or spin around once).In relation to its orbit around the Sun, its axis is tilted by 26.73 degrees, which is comparable to Earth's 23.5-degree tilt.  This indicates that Saturn has seasons, just like Earth.",
    "magnetosphere":"Saturn's magnetic field is smaller than Jupiter's but still 578 times as powerful as Earth's. Saturn, the rings, and many of the satellites lie totally within Saturn's enormous magnetosphere, the region of space in which the behavior of electrically charged particles is influenced more by Saturn's magnetic field than by the solar wind."
